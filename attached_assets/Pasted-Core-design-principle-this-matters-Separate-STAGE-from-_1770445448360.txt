Core design principle (this matters)
🔑 Separate STAGE from STATUS

Stage = where the job is in the pipeline (big buckets)

Status = what is currently happening / what’s blocking it (actionable)

Field staff mostly touch status.
Sales/admin own stage transitions.

This keeps it simple without losing control.

1️⃣ High-level sales stages (do NOT overdo this)

Keep stages few and stable.
I’d strongly recommend 6 stages max.

Recommended stages

Opportunity

Pre-Qualification

Estimating / Tender

Submitted

Awarded

Lost

These should almost never change once agreed.

2️⃣ Statuses inside each stage (this is where clarity lives)

Statuses are contextual to a stage and answer:

“What’s happening right now?”
“What is the next action?”

Stage 1 — OPPORTUNITY (field-driven)

Purpose: fast capture, minimal friction

Statuses:

New opportunity logged

Client contacted

Awaiting drawings

Awaiting scope info

Site visit required

Site visit completed

Not suitable (scope mismatch)

Duplicate / already quoted

👉 Field guys should be able to:

create opportunity

change status in one tap

add a short note or photo

Stage 2 — PRE-QUALIFICATION (office-led, but visible)

Purpose: decide if it’s worth estimating

Statuses:

Reviewing client

Reviewing scope fit

Capacity check

Pricing strategy review

Approved for estimating

Declined – capacity

Declined – risk profile

Declined – not our market

Rule of thumb:

Only 1–2 people can move it out of this stage

Field guys can still see what’s happening

Stage 3 — ESTIMATING / TENDER

Purpose: real work happens here

Statuses:

Drawings received

Reviewing drawings

RFIs issued

Awaiting RFI response

Estimating in progress

Internal review

Tender pricing approved

Tender being prepared

Ready to submit

Optional (but useful):

“Estimator assigned” (user field)

“Target submission date”

Stage 4 — SUBMITTED

Purpose: waiting, chasing, clarifying

Statuses:

Tender submitted

Awaiting feedback

Clarification requested

Clarification provided

Value engineering requested

Pricing revision submitted

Shortlisted

This stage should feel calm and transparent.

Stage 5 — AWARDED

Purpose: convert to contract cleanly

Statuses:

Letter of intent received

Contract under review

Contract negotiations

Contract executed

Handed over to delivery

🚨 This is where your sales → contract → onboarding system plugs in.

Stage 6 — LOST (close it properly)

Purpose: learn, don’t just bin it

Statuses:

Lost – price

Lost – scope

Lost – timing

Lost – client decision

Lost – competitor

Lost – no feedback

Make lost reason mandatory before closing.

This data becomes gold later.

3️⃣ “What’s next?” without complexity

Every status should optionally define:

Next action

Owner

Suggested due date

Example:

Status: Awaiting drawings

Next action: “Follow up client”

Owner: Field rep

Due: +3 days

But keep this optional, not forced.

4️⃣ Field workflow (speed matters)

For guys in the field, the UI should be:

Create opportunity (≤ 60 seconds)

Client name

Project name

Location

Rough scope (free text)

Estimated value (optional)

Photo upload (optional)

Status auto-set to “New opportunity logged”

Update status

One dropdown

Optional note

Optional photo

No mandatory long forms. Ever.

5️⃣ Admin / sales workflow (control matters)

Admin users can:

Change stage

Assign estimator

Set target dates

Lock certain statuses (e.g. “Approved for estimating”)

Convert Awarded → Contract record

Rules:

Stage change = deliberate

Status change = lightweight

6️⃣ Simple data model (buildable, not over-engineered)
sales_opportunities

id

project_name

client_name

location

rough_scope

estimated_value

stage (enum)

status (enum)

owner_user_id (field rep)

assigned_sales_user_id

assigned_estimator_user_id

created_at / updated_at

sales_status_history

opportunity_id

stage

status

note

changed_by_user_id

created_at

This gives you:

audit trail

analytics

zero complexity in UI

7️⃣ Guardrails to keep it simple

✔ Limit stages
✔ Status list changes per stage
✔ One-tap status updates
✔ Notes optional, not mandatory
✔ Admin owns stage movement
✔ Field owns status updates

8️⃣ What I’d avoid (based on experience)

🚫 Too many stages
🚫 Global status list (confusing)
🚫 Mandatory fields on every update
🚫 Forcing CRM-style “activities”
🚫 Letting everyone change everything

9️⃣ Replit build prompt (clean and focused)

You can paste this directly:

“Implement a sales workflow module with a small fixed set of pipeline stages (Opportunity, Pre-Qualification, Estimating, Submitted, Awarded, Lost) and stage-specific statuses. Field users must be able to quickly create opportunities and update status with optional notes/photos. Admin users manage stage transitions, assignments, and conversions to contracts. Track full status history. Design the UI to be fast, minimal, and mobile-friendly. Do not overcomplicate with CRM-style tasks.”
