Asset Register (Asset Management) - Complete Guide
What It Does
A comprehensive asset tracking and lifecycle management system for construction, precast manufacturing, and development companies. It tracks every physical asset from purchase (or lease) through its entire lifespan - including depreciation, maintenance, insurance, transfers, and disposal. Assets can be linked to approved CAPEX requests, and AI can generate asset analysis summaries.
