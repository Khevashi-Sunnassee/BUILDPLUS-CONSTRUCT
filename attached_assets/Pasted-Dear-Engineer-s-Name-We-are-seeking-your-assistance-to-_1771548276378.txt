Dear [Engineer’s Name],

We are seeking your assistance to undertake a comprehensive electrical infrastructure assessment for a proposed multi-storey development at [Site Address].

The purpose of this engagement is to determine the feasibility, requirements, risks, and authority interfaces associated with supplying permanent mains power to the site.

We require a detailed investigation and advice covering the following:

1. Load Assessment

Preliminary maximum demand calculation based on proposed building use and scale (including common areas, lifts, mechanical plant, car park ventilation, base building services, and tenancy allowances).

Diversity assumptions adopted.

Allowance for future capacity where appropriate.

2. Existing Infrastructure Investigation

Identification of existing electrical infrastructure servicing or adjacent to the site (HV/LV mains, overhead/underground assets).

Confirmation of available capacity from the local distribution network.

Identification of the serving authority and any known network constraints.

Preliminary liaison (if required) with the relevant electricity distributor to confirm supply strategy.

3. Substation Requirements

Confirmation whether an on-site substation is required.

Recommended substation type (kiosk, ground-mounted, internal chamber, basement, etc.).

Preliminary sizing requirements.

Authority-specific design constraints.

Clear spatial requirements (footprint, clearances, ventilation, access).

Typical construction and compliance requirements.

4. Access & Constructability

Access requirements for authority vehicles (crane, transformer delivery/removal).

Easement requirements.

Clearance zones and authority access restrictions.

Impacts on architectural design and basement configuration.

Identification of any abnormal site constraints affecting installation.

5. Authority & Approval Pathway

Outline of the application process with the distributor.

High-level timeframe for approvals and energisation.

Identification of long lead items (e.g., transformers, switchgear).

Headworks or augmentation triggers.

6. Budget & Risk Commentary

Order-of-magnitude cost estimate for:

Incoming supply works

Substation supply and installation

Authority augmentation (if triggered)

Identification of key risks that could materially impact cost or programme.

7. Deliverables Required
Please provide:

A brief written report addressing the above items

Marked-up site plan showing preferred supply entry and substation location

Preliminary load summary table

Risk matrix (capacity, augmentation, programme, authority approvals)

High-level programme for authority engagement and energisation

Our objective is to understand:

Whether the site can be serviced without major augmentation

Whether an on-site substation is required and its implications

The spatial and cost impacts on the development

The authority approval pathway and programme risks

Please confirm your proposed fee and timeframe to complete this assessment.

We can provide architectural drawings, preliminary services layouts, and development yield assumptions upon confirmation.

Kind regards,
