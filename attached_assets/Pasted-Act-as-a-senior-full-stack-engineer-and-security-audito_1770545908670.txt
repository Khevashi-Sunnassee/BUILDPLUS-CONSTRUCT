Act as a senior full-stack engineer and security auditor.

Run a comprehensive debugging and quality-assurance pass across the entire application.

Your task is to:

1. Frontend
   - Validate React/TypeScript correctness
   - Check for invalid React element types, broken imports, hooks misuse, state leaks
   - Enforce strict TypeScript rules (no implicit any, unsafe casts, unused exports)
   - Run ESLint and flag all violations
   - Detect performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, large bundles, blocking renders)

2. Backend
   - Validate all API endpoints exist, are reachable, and return consistent schemas
   - Ensure every protected endpoint enforces authentication and permissions
   - Validate request/response schema validation on all endpoints
   - Detect missing or inconsistent error handling
   - Check database access patterns for N+1 queries, missing indexes, unsafe transactions

3. Security
   - Verify CSRF protection for all cookie-based write operations
   - Validate secure cookie flags, SameSite policy, and session handling
   - Check for XSS, injection risks, unsafe eval or dynamic execution
   - Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Ensure secrets are not hard-coded and only loaded from environment variables
   - Validate security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

4. TypeScript & Build Integrity
   - Run a full TypeScript typecheck with noEmit
   - Ensure the application builds cleanly with no warnings
   - Detect circular dependencies and invalid imports

5. Performance & Scalability
   - Simulate load assumptions of 200+ concurrent users
   - Identify latency bottlenecks (API p95, slow pages, blocking I/O)
   - Check database connection pooling and resource limits
   - Identify operations that should be queued or backgrounded

6. Rules Compliance
   - Verify the codebase follows its own architectural and coding rules
   - Flag any deviation from established patterns or conventions

7. Output
   - Produce a single structured report summarising:
     - Critical issues
     - Warnings
     - Recommended fixes (with file references)
   - Assign an overall Application Health Score (0–100)
   - Assign a letter grade (A–F)
   - Clearly state whether the application is SAFE TO DEPLOY or BLOCKED

Be strict, assume production risk, and do not ignore issues.
If something is unclear, surface it as a risk instead of guessing.
