You are acting as a Senior Staff Engineer + QA Lead.

Perform a FULL, COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT of this Replit application to determine if it is
STABLE, SECURE, SCALABLE, and ENTERPRISE-READY.

Do NOT summarize quickly. Inspect the actual codebase and reason carefully.

Your review MUST include the following sections:

1) APPLICATION OVERVIEW
- Identify the tech stack (frontend, backend, database, frameworks, versions).
- Identify runtime environment and deployment assumptions.

2) UI / FRONTEND REVIEW
- Check for broken UI flows, missing states, loading/error handling.
- Validate forms, validation logic, accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, contrast).
- Review responsiveness and browser compatibility.
- Identify performance issues (over-rendering, blocking requests).
- Flag UX inconsistencies or confusing flows.

3) API & BACKEND REVIEW
- Enumerate ALL API endpoints and routes.
- Verify HTTP methods, status codes, error handling consistency.
- Check authentication & authorization enforcement.
- Validate input sanitization and schema validation.
- Check for race conditions, idempotency, and retries.
- Identify unhandled promise rejections or crashes.

4) DATABASE & DATA MODEL REVIEW
- Enumerate all databases, tables/collections, and schemas.
- Validate relationships, indexes, constraints, and naming conventions.
- Check for N+1 queries, missing indexes, or full table scans.
- Review migrations, seed data, and rollback strategy.
- Check data consistency, null handling, and edge cases.

5) SECURITY REVIEW (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Check for exposed secrets, API keys, tokens, credentials.
- Verify environment variables usage (Replit Secrets).
- Review auth flows, session handling, token expiration.
- Check for OWASP Top 10 risks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, auth bypass).
- Validate CORS, rate limiting, and request size limits.

6) INTEGRATIONS & EXTERNAL APIS
- Review Google Maps, email (Gmail/SMTP/API), and any other integrations.
- Validate API key usage, restrictions, quotas, and error handling.
- Check retry logic, timeouts, and graceful degradation.

7) ERROR HANDLING & OBSERVABILITY
- Review logging strategy (what is logged, what is NOT).
- Identify missing logs for failures and critical paths.
- Check monitoring, alerts, and health checks.
- Validate graceful shutdown and recovery behavior.

8) PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY
- Identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, I/O, DB).
- Review async usage and blocking calls.
- Evaluate readiness for higher traffic and concurrency.
- Identify limits of Replit hosting and mitigation strategies.

9) TESTING & QUALITY
- Check for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Identify untested critical paths.
- Suggest test cases that MUST be added before production.
- Validate test data isolation.

10) CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT
- Review environment configuration per stage (dev/staging/prod).
- Check startup scripts, build steps, and failure modes.
- Validate dependency versions and lockfiles.

11) FAILURE SCENARIOS
- Simulate API failures, DB downtime, invalid inputs, and partial outages.
- Identify what breaks and how to harden it.

12) FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT
- Categorize issues as CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW.
- Explicitly state whether the app is ENTERPRISE-READY or NOT.
- Provide a prioritized remediation checklist.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Be strict. Assume production traffic.
- Assume malicious users exist.
- Do not be polite — be accurate.
- Call out EVERY issue, even small ones.
- If something cannot be verified, say so explicitly.
